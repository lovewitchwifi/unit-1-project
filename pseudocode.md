/*
create object array with all necessary information

id, question, answer, value

Then we will have functions to display the question and answer

[function]
displayQuestion(categoryIndex, questionIndex) {
Display the question on the game board
  let category = categories[categoryIndex];
  let question = questions[category][questionIndex];
}

[function]
Display the answer on the game board
  let category = categories[categoryIndex];
  let answer = questions[category][questionIndex].answers;


Then we need a loop to let the player select a question and answer and then check if that answer is correct. 

[loop]
let user click question by making it a button

[function]
display question 
let user submit answer (this is the part that i dont know... how will they give their answer hmmm)

[loop]
if user answer === category index question index answer index
then add $ to winnings box
[else]
remove $ from winnings box and display correct answer
